# iHub-Data, IIIT Hyderabad â€” Summer Internship 2025

This repository contains my work completed during the **Summer Internship 2025** at [iHub-Data, IIIT Hyderabad](https://ihub-data.iiit.ac.in/).  
The internship focused on **hands-on computer vision projects** using **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for **object detection** and **segmentation** tasks with real-world and custom datasets.

Each task involved solving practical computer vision challenges, ranging from **basic segmentation** to **full model training**, with a strong emphasis on **dataset preparation, annotation, and evaluation**.

## ðŸ“Œ Internship Tasks Overview

- **Task 1** â€” Introductory image segmentation with existing datasets.
- **Task 2A** â€” Local image segmentation using YOLOv8.
- **Task 2B** â€” Video frame extraction using `ffmpeg`, segmentation of each frame, and recombining into a video.
- **Task 3** â€” Model training & evaluation on curated datasets.
- **Task 4** â€” Custom dataset creation, annotation, and YOLOv8 training.
- **Final Phase** â€” End-to-end pipeline: dataset preparation â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment-ready results.
